# It didn't work!

If someone just linked you to this, you have tested positive for Stupid Bitch disease. The primary symptom is saying that your code "didn't work" with no explanation, or otherwise doing a really shitty job when asking a question or getting help with a code issue. As you can see, this can have serious consequences for the friends and loved ones of the affected.

Thankfully, there is a cure. Please take the following prescription:

- Check the **Troubleshooting guide** to see if your issue already has a detailed guide on how to fix it.
- If this didn't help, go back to where you previously posted and specify:
	- Your operating system and the version you're trying to build, if any.
	- What action you take that triggers the issue.
	- The symptoms of the issue.
	- Post the error message that occurs if you can. 
- In particular, if you would ever respond in regards to a coding issue with "it didn't work", please try the following statements instead:
	- When I try this, I see the same error as before, with no changes.
	- When I try this, a different error appears.
	- When I try this, XXX happens instead.
	- When I try this, no error appears and the expected behavior does not happen.
	
Remember: Fixing code is like fixing a car. If you go to your local mechanic and say "It doesn't work", they aren't going to be able to help you, or if they are, they will waste a lot of time doing it. You need to specify the symptoms that occur.
	
With this advice, you may one day be able to recover from this debilitating ailment.
